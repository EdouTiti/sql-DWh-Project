## Azure Data warehouse and Load of data

The project focuses on designing and implementing a modern Azure-based Data Warehouse and Analytics Platform that integrates multiple structured data sources (customers, leads, organizations, people, and products).
It leverages Azure DWh, Data Factory, and Power BI to enable end-to-end data ingestion, transformation, and visualization.

Key objectives include:

Establishing a centralized data warehouse as a single source of truth for business intelligence.

Building automated ETL pipelines to process and unify data from heterogeneous sources (CSV, ERP, CRM).

Implementing semantic data models to support real-time reporting and performance tracking.

Developing interactive dashboards for insights into customer behavior, lead conversion, and product performance.

The solution ensures data consistency, scalability, and governance, empowering decision-makers with actionable insights for strategic planning and operational excellence.
